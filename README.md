[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/ipinfo/go/v2/ipinfo.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipinfo/go/v2/ipinfo)

This is the official Go client library for the [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) IP address API, allowing you to lookup your own IP address, or get any of the following details for other IP addresses:

- [IP to Geolocation](https://ipinfo.io/ip-geolocation-api) (city, region, country, postal code, latitude and longitude)
- [IP to ASN](https://ipinfo.io/asn-api) (ISP or network operator, associated domain name, and type, such as business, hosting or company)
- [IP to Company](https://ipinfo.io/ip-company-api) (the name and domain of the business that uses the IP address)
- [IP to Carrier](https://ipinfo.io/ip-carrier-api) (the name of the mobile carrier and MNC and MCC for that carrier if the IP is used exclusively for mobile traffic)

Check all the data we have for your IP address [here](https://ipinfo.io/what-is-my-ip).
